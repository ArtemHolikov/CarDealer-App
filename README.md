This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## How to build?

 To create an optimized build for production, run the following command:
 ```
npm run build
```
This command compiles your application and prepares it for production by generating the necessary files in the .next folder.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Take into account:

To be honest, it's my first time working on Next.js. I've not worked before with Next. So there are might be a lot of bad quality code. But I like it and ready to improve myself in case I receieve the offer :)
